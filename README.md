# Soil-Analyzer-Program
Grade 12 Physics Final Summative. Developed by Victor Guo, Andrew Yuan, Rong Tao Luo, Fardin Islam, and Praveen Jey.

## Features
The program is made for a robotic arm with the purpose of collecting soil for analysis of mass, volume, colorimetry, and temperature. Arduino was used for the motors and sensors and Processing was used for the GUI. Our project had a webcam attached so users could select a location on the camera feed for the arm to collect soil from. The collected soil is brought to an analysis unit and analyzed until it's later disposed.
